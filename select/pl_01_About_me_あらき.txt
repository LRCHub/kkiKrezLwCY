I have a story to tell
Do you hear me tonight
It's things about me
I'll be waiting in bedroom
But anyway you can't come
I get it,never mind
Now, it is starting to rain
I feel you drop tears
And my heart become heavy
What's this world coming to?
There's nothing that can be done
I couldn't careless
It's wonderful for me that
world is moving now
Some lights turn
around and around
I lost my head again
And just want to throw
everything away
It's not that easy
Maybe I'm afraid I'm not as
tender guy as you think
Looking your eyes, and
I say "love you" with fake smile
I don't know what to do
Please tell me what should I do
Just feel so sad inside,
but I kiss you
Kiss you...
I have a story to tell
Do you hear me tonight

I'll be waiting in bedroom
But anyway you can't come
I get it, never mind
I can't get my mind off you
I'm such an idiot
Same as usual
You made me feel so better
It brings back memories
It's things about you
My hands can't take back that
the time I passed with you
Some doubts broke me down,
broke me down
If you are still alive,
I wanted to say it's not your
fault But it's too late for us
Maybe I'm afraid I'm not as
tender guy as you think
Looking your eyes, and
I say "love you" with fake smile
I don't know what to do
Please tell me what should I do
Just feel so sad inside,
but I kiss you
Kiss you...
It's wonderful for me that
world is moving now
Some lights turn around and
around
I lost my head again
And just want to throw
everything away
It's not that easy
気付いた時には終わりを告げ
全てが僕を笑うんだろう？
風が冷たいこんな日は
君を思い出すよ
Maybe I'm afraid I'm not as
tender guy as you think
I close my eyes, and
I say "love you" with true smile
I don't know what to do
Please tell me what should I do
Just feel so sad inside,
but say good-bye
Good-bye...
