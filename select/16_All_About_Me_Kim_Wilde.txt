Waking between night and day
I'm floating over hills and mountains
Trying to find a place I've never been
Throw my cares away
The sun kisses my soul
And peace has taken hold

It's all about me
It's not about you
I need to be free
I've got to be true
It's nothing you said
It's nothing you do
It's all in my head
I've got to move on
Don't have to be sad
You know that I care
I'll never forget
The things that we shared
I know my heart
It never felt bad
It's not about you

...It's all about me
It's all about me
