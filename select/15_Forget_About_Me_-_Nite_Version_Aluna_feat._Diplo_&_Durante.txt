Forget about me
You and me ain't what we used to be
You keep saying I've changed
I guarantee I'll be who I choose to be
You wanna keep me the same
I can't help it if I'm on your mind, on your mind
And all of the ways I'm leaving you behind, you behind
I can't help it if I'm on your mind, on your mind
You got to, you got to forget about me
Forget about me
'Cause we ain't matching signs
It ain't destiny, it ain't written in the stars
So forget about me, I can't lie
You got to, you got to forget about me
Forget about me
Forget about me
Forget about me
You got to, you got to forget about me
Not my fault if you ain't ready
My evolution drives you crazy
I can't help it if I'm on your mind, on your mind
And all of the ways I'm leaving you behind, you behind
I can't help it if I'm on your mind, on your mind
You got to, you got to forget about me
Forget about me
'Cause we ain't matching signs
It ain't destiny, it ain't written in the stars
So forget about me, I can't lie
You got to, you got to forget about me
Forget about me, forget about me
It ain't destiny, it ain't destiny
'Cause we ain't matching signs
It ain't destiny, it ain't destiny
'Cause we ain't matching signs
So forget about me
'Cause we ain't matching signs
It ain't destiny, it ain't written in the stars
So forget about me, I can't lie
You got to, you got to forget about me
Forget about me, forget about me
You got to, you got to forget about me
